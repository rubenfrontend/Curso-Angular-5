mdbInputDirective has three of the above directives - mdbActive, mdbInputValidate and mdbDeepDirective.

mdbActive is used by default and we do not anticipate that you will be able to disable it.

mdbInputValidate is used by default, but the user can disable validation by using the [mdbValidate]="false" control on input which contains mdbInputDirective.

mdbDeepDirective is used by default when used on a checkbox or radio. It is possible to disable it by using [focusCheckbox]="false" and [focusRadio]="false".

mdbRippleRadius was changed to mdbWavesEffect. mdbRippleRadius will be deleted after next release.
